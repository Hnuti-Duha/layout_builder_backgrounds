This is my version of the layout_builder_backgrounds module on drupal.org (https://www.drupal.org/project/layout_builder_backgrounds). All credits to the original author. 
I have made modification to the storage to ensure settings are saved in the third party setings of the section instead of in the lay-out.

For functioning is need "Third party should be allowed to alter the section render array"
